<h2> what is big wave surfing </b></h2><!--  כותרת -->
<!--  טקסט -->
Big wave surfing is a discipline within surfing in which experienced surfers paddle into, or are towed into, 
waves which are at least 20 feet (6.2 m) high, on surf boards known as "guns" or towboards.[1] Sizes of the board 
needed to successfully surf 
these waves vary by the size of the wave as well as the technique the surfer uses to reach the wave. A larger, 
longer board allows a rider to paddle 
fast enough to catch the wave and has the advantage of being more stable, but it also limits maneuverability 
and surfing speed.
